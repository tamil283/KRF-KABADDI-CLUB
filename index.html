  <p>KRF FULL MEANING KOZHIYUR ROCKY FRIENDS**Kabaddi** is a contact team sport that originated in ancient India. The name "kabaddi" comes from the Tamil word **"kai-pidi"**, which means "to hold hands"—a reference to the defensive formations used in the game.

### Basic Meaning:

Kabaddi is a game where players from two teams take turns sending a "raider" into the opposing team’s half of the court. The raider tries to tag as many defenders as possible and return to their own half **without being tackled**, all while chanting "kabaddi, kabaddi" continuously in a single breath.

### Key Elements:

* **Teams**: Two teams with 7 players each.
* **Raider**: The attacking player who enters the opponent’s side.
* **Defenders**: Players who try to stop the raider.
* **Tag and return**: The goal is to tag opponents and get back safely.
* **No breath holding**: The raider must keep chanting "kabaddi" without inhaling.

### Objective:

Score points by:

* **Tagging opponents** as a raider.
* **Tackling the raider** as defenders.

Kabaddi is popular in South Asia (especially India, Bangladesh, Iran, and Pakistan) and is now played internationally, with leagues and tournaments such as the **Pro Kabaddi League** and **Asian Games**.
